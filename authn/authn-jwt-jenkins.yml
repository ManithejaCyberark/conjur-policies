    # Optional: Uncomment any or all of the following variables:
    # * token-app-propery
    # * identity-path
    # * issuer
    # identity-path is always used together with token-app-property
    # however, token-app-property can be used without identity-path

      id: token-app-property
      annotations:
        description: JWT Authenticator bases authentication on claims from the JWT. You can base authentication on identifying clams such as the name, the user, and so on. If you can customize the JWT, you can create a custom claim and base authentication on this claim.

    - !variable
      id: identity-path
      annotations:
        description: JWT Authenticator bases authentication on a combination of the claim in the token-app-property and the full path of the application identity (host) in Conjur. This variable is optional, and is used in conjunction with token-app-property. It has no purpose when standing alone.

    - !variable
      id: issuer
      annotations:
          description: JWT Authenticator bases authentication on the JWT issuer. This variable is optional, and is relevant only if there is an iss claim in the JWT. The issuer variable and iss claim values must match.

    # Mandatory: The JWT Provider URI: You must provide either a provider-uri or jwks-uri

    #   annotations:
    #     description: The JWT provider URI. Relevant only for JWT providers that support the Open ID Connect (OIDC) protocol.

    - !variable
      id: jwks-uri
      annotations:
        description: A JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) URI. If the JWKS vendor provides both a jwks-uri and an equivalent provider-uri, you can use the provider-uri which has an easier interface to work with.
